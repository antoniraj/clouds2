Incorrect command line parameters (Input file not specified).

Command line usage: "fet --inputfile=x [--outputdir=d] [--timelimitseconds=y] [--htmllevel=z] [--language=t] [--printnotavailable=u] [--printbreak=b] [--dividetimeaxisbydays=v] [--printsimultaneousactivities=w] [--randomseedx=rx --randomseedy=ry] [--warnifusingnotperfectconstraints=s] [--warnifusingstudentsminhoursdailywithallowemptydays=p]",
where:
x is the input file, for instance "data.fet"
d is the path to results directory, without trailing slash or backslash (default is current working path). Make sure you have write permissions there.
y is integer (seconds) (default 2000000000, which is practically infinite).
z is integer from 0 to 6 and represents the detail level for the generated html timetables (default 2, larger values have more details/facilities and larger file sizes).
t is one of en_US, ar, ca, da, de, el, es, fa, fr, gl, he, hu, id, it, lt, mk, ms, nl, pl, pt_BR, ro, ru, si, sk, sr, tr, uk (default en_US).
u is either "true" or "false" and represents if you want -x- (for true) or --- (for false) in the generated timetables for the not available slots (default true).
b is either "true" or "false" and represents if you want -X- (for true) or --- (for false) in the generated timetables for the break slots (default true).
v is either true or false, represents if you want html timetables with time-axis divided by days (default false).
w is either true or false, represents if you want html timetables to show related activities which have constraints with same starting time (default false).
(for instance, if A1 (T1, G1) and A2 (T2, G2) have constraint activities same starting time, then in T1's timetable will appear also A2, at the same slot as A1).
rx is the random seed X component, minimum 1 to maximum 2147483646, ry is the random seed Y component, minimum 1 to maximum 2147483398 (you can get the same timetable if the input file is identical, if the FET version is the same and if the random seed X and Y components are the same).
s is either true or false, represents whether you want a message box to be shown, with a warning, if the input file contains not perfect constraints (activity tag max hours daily or students max gaps per day) (default true).
p is either true or false, represents whether you want a message box to be shown, with a warning, if the input file contains non standard constraints students min hours daily with allow empty days (default true).

Alternatively, you can run "fet --version [--outputdir=d]" to get the current FET version. where:
d is the path to results directory, without trailing slash or backslash (default is current working path). Make sure you have write permissions there.
(If you specify the "--version" argument, FET just prints version number on the command line prompt and in the output directory and exits.)
